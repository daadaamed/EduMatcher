# Edumapper – Nuxt + TypeScript + Tailwind v4

A UI prototype implementation for a Edumapper

## Stack
- Nuxt 4, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`)

## Features

This prototype helps a student quickly select their lycée, classe, and spécialités using simple, reusable cards with explicit confirmation to prevent mistakes.  

With one “Confirmer” action, inputs are summarized and the student is routed to a results page that clearly communicates admission likelihood (percentage ring + reliability stars).  

The layout is mobile-first and fast, ensuring a smooth experience on phone, tablet, and desktop.  
Components are reusable and data-driven, making it easy to add programs or criteria without changing the overall UX.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
